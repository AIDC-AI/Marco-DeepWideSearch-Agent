🎯 Marco-DeepWideSearch-Agent introduces two challenging agent benchmarks that expose critical gaps in current AI systems across two fundamental dimensions:

1. **HSCodeComp** ([`HSCodeComp`](HSCodeComp/README.md)): Evaluates **hierarchical rule application** in E-Commerce—*"What is the correct 10-digit HSCode for this silicone medical bracelet?"*. This benchmark tests the ability to apply complex, ambiguous rules embedded with hierarchical decision logic (e.g., tariff, legal, medical manuals) in domain-specific applications.

2. **DeepWideSearch** ([`DeepWideSearch`](DeepWideSearch/README.md)): Evaluates **deep-and-wide information seeking**—*"List all second-tier suppliers of Apple's AirPods, with contact info, location, and certification status."* This benchmark requires agents to simultaneously discover a large volume of candidates through wide-scale exploration and perform deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval for each candidate.

These applications reveal fundamental limitations between current AI agents and human experts in critical yet underexplored dimensions of real-world applications.

⚠️ **Limitations**: We acknowledge that the current benchmarks primarily expose fundamental limitations in existing agent systems and their performance still falls short of human-level capabilities in these domains. This is not a one-time effort, and we remain committed to continuous optimization and ongoing improvement of both the benchmarks and the underlying agent architectures.

## 📦 Included Benchmarks

### 📑 [**HSCodeComp**](HSCodeComp/README.md)

*Evaluating Advanced Agent Systems on Hierarchical Rule Application in E-Commerce Domain*

- **Task**: Predict 10-digit Harmonized System (HS) Code from noisy product listings using official tariff rules.
- **Size**: 632 expert-annotated products
- **Domains**: 27 HS chapters, 32 e-commerce categories
- **Key Challenge**: Hierarchical rules contain **vague language** and **implicit decision logic**.
- **Human Performance**: **95.0%** (10-digit accuracy)
- **Best AI (SmolAgent + GPT-5 VLM)**: **46.8%**

> 💡 *Reveals that even top-performming agents fail at complex hierarchical rule application—a core skill in numerous important vertical domains, like law, customs, and E-Commernce.*

---

### 🌐 [**DeepWideSearch**](HSCodeComp/README.md)

*Evaluating Advanced Agent Systems on Deep-and-Wide Agentic Information Seeking*

- **Task**: Answer complex queries by producing **structured tables** (entities × attributes).
- **Size**: 220 multi-hop, multi-attribute questions (English & Chinese)
- **Avg. Output**: 414 information units per answer
- **Avg. Reasoning Depth**: 4.21 steps
- **Best AI (WebSailor + Claude Sonnet 4)**: **2.39% Success Rate**

> 💡 *Shows that advanced AI agents achieve only nearly 2% success rate with huge inference cost.*
